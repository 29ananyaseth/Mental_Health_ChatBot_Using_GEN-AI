## 📚 System Architecture

Here’s how it all works together:

->User Input: User submits a question or query.

->Document Upload: PDFs are uploaded for analysis, split into chunks using LangChain's text splitters.

->Text Vectorization: Hugging Face embeddings convert chunks into searchable vectors.

->Chroma DB: Stores embeddings for easy retrieval during queries.

->Groq Cloud (Llama): Processes the input, retrieves relevant data, and generates responses.

->Gradio UI: Provides the user-friendly chat interface for seamless interactions.
